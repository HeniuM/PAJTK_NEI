Rules of the game "Game of Knights":

1. The game is played on a board of size 8x8 (or another size depending on the board size chosen at the start).

2. Each player controls one knight, which starts the game in opposite corners of the board:
- Player 1 starts in the top-left corner.
- Player 2 (or AI) starts in the bottom-right corner.

3. The knights move like in chess, performing an "L"-shaped move:
- Two squares in one direction, then one square in a perpendicular direction, or one square in one direction, then two squares in another direction.

4. After a move is made, the square from which the knight moved becomes blocked and cannot be returned to for the rest of the game.

5. Players take turns making moves, trying to avoid the blocked squares.

6. The goal of the game is to avoid being in a situation where you have no available moves:
- The player who cannot make a legal move loses the game.

7. The game ends when one of the players has no legal moves remaining.

8. Moves must follow the knight's movement rules, and blocked squares are unavailable to the players.
